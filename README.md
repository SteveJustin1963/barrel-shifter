# barrel-shifter

A barrel shifter is a digital circuit that can shift a data word by a specified number of bits without the use of any iterative/combinatorial logic, thus providing a very fast operation. Barrel shifters can perform both logical shifts (zero-filled) and arithmetic shifts (sign-extended for negative numbers, in the case of a right shift), as well as rotations.

### Basic Principles

1. **Parallelism**: A barrel shifter can shift data in one clock cycle because it performs all required movements simultaneously.

2. **Multiplexer-Based**: A typical barrel shifter employs a complex array of multiplexers to decide from where to take the input bit for each output bit, depending on the shift distance.

3. **Constant Time**: The shifting/rotation is performed in constant time regardless of the number of positions to be shifted. This is different from a shift register, where the operation time would be proportional to the shift distance.

4. **Multiple Operations**: Barrel shifters can also be designed to perform multiple shifts or rotations simultaneously, such as a left-rotate or a right-rotate in a single operation.

5. **Flexibility**: The circuit can be designed to be flexible in terms of word length and the number of shift positions, although this increases complexity.

### Architecture

The architecture can vary, but the essential components are:

1. **Input Lines**: One set of input lines carries the data word to be shifted.

2. **Shift Value**: Another set of lines carries the number of positions to shift the data word.

3. **Control Lines**: Specify the type of operation (shift left, shift right, rotate, etc.).

4. **Multiplexers**: These are the primary elements responsible for the shifting action. A multiplexer array is often organized into multiple stages to enable shifting by more than one bit at a time.

5. **Output Lines**: The shifted word is available at the output lines.

### Types of Barrel Shifters

1. **Rotative Barrel Shifter**: This shifter rotates the input word, effectively treating it as a closed loop.

2. **Logical Barrel Shifter**: This shifter shifts in zeros when moving bits, which is primarily used for unsigned numbers.

3. **Arithmetic Barrel Shifter**: This type performs sign extension when shifting to the right and is mainly used for signed numbers.

### Use Cases

1. **Processors**: Many CPU architectures incorporate barrel shifters to rapidly perform bit manipulations, crucial for arithmetic calculations, data packing/unpacking, etc.

2. **Hardware Accelerators**: Dedicated hardware for applications like cryptography or signal processing often leverage fast barrel shifters.

3. **FPGAs and ASICs**: Custom circuits for specific applications may integrate barrel shifters for their speed advantage.

By offering fast and flexible shifting operations, barrel shifters play a critical role in modern digital systems. They offer a significant speed advantage, especially when time-sensitive bit manipulation is required.

This implementation includes several key optimizations and features:

1. Lookup Table Based:
- Pre-computed shift values for fast operation
- No iterative shifting required
- Constant-time operation

2. Multiple Operation Types:
- Logical left shift
- Logical right shift
- Arithmetic right shift (with sign extension)
- Rotate left
- Rotate right

3. Key Functions:
- I: Initialize lookup tables
- M: Get mask from lookup table
- L: Logical left shift
- R: Logical right shift
- A: Arithmetic right shift
- T: Rotate left
- U: Rotate right
- S: Main shift function
- X: Test function

4. Optimizations:
- Uses lookup tables instead of loops
- Minimizes branching
- Efficient bit manipulation
- Fixed-width operations for predictable results

To use:
```mint
// Format: value type positions
#1234 0 4 S .  // Shift #1234 left by 4 positions
#8000 2 1 S .  // Arithmetic right shift #8000 by 1
```

add:
1. Add more test cases?
2. Include additional optimization techniques?
3. Add support for other bit manipulation operations?



//////////////
To make the Z80 assembly barrel shifter code faster and more efficient, we can make the following changes:

Use a table lookup for the shift amount: Instead of using a loop to shift the value by the specified amount, we can use a table lookup to perform the shift in a single instruction. This will be much faster, especially for large shift amounts.
Use a carry flag to track the shift direction: Instead of using a separate variable to track the shift direction, we can use the carry flag. This will save us one register and make the code more concise.
Eliminate unnecessary branches: There are a few unnecessary branches in the code that we can eliminate. This will make the code more efficient and easier to optimize.
Here is a rewritten version of the barrel shifter code that incorporates these changes:
