# barrel-shifter


Forth-83 code for a barrel shifter

bs.f


To make the Z80 assembly barrel shifter code faster and more efficient, we can make the following changes:

Use a table lookup for the shift amount: Instead of using a loop to shift the value by the specified amount, we can use a table lookup to perform the shift in a single instruction. This will be much faster, especially for large shift amounts.
Use a carry flag to track the shift direction: Instead of using a separate variable to track the shift direction, we can use the carry flag. This will save us one register and make the code more concise.
Eliminate unnecessary branches: There are a few unnecessary branches in the code that we can eliminate. This will make the code more efficient and easier to optimize.
Here is a rewritten version of the barrel shifter code that incorporates these changes:
