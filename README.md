# barrel-shifter

A barrel shifter is a digital circuit that can shift a data word by a specified number of bits without the use of any iterative/combinatorial logic, thus providing a very fast operation. Barrel shifters can perform both logical shifts (zero-filled) and arithmetic shifts (sign-extended for negative numbers, in the case of a right shift), as well as rotations.

### Basic Principles

1. **Parallelism**: A barrel shifter can shift data in one clock cycle because it performs all required movements simultaneously.

2. **Multiplexer-Based**: A typical barrel shifter employs a complex array of multiplexers to decide from where to take the input bit for each output bit, depending on the shift distance.

3. **Constant Time**: The shifting/rotation is performed in constant time regardless of the number of positions to be shifted. This is different from a shift register, where the operation time would be proportional to the shift distance.

4. **Multiple Operations**: Barrel shifters can also be designed to perform multiple shifts or rotations simultaneously, such as a left-rotate or a right-rotate in a single operation.

5. **Flexibility**: The circuit can be designed to be flexible in terms of word length and the number of shift positions, although this increases complexity.

### Architecture

The architecture can vary, but the essential components are:

1. **Input Lines**: One set of input lines carries the data word to be shifted.

2. **Shift Value**: Another set of lines carries the number of positions to shift the data word.

3. **Control Lines**: Specify the type of operation (shift left, shift right, rotate, etc.).

4. **Multiplexers**: These are the primary elements responsible for the shifting action. A multiplexer array is often organized into multiple stages to enable shifting by more than one bit at a time.

5. **Output Lines**: The shifted word is available at the output lines.

### Types of Barrel Shifters

1. **Rotative Barrel Shifter**: This shifter rotates the input word, effectively treating it as a closed loop.

2. **Logical Barrel Shifter**: This shifter shifts in zeros when moving bits, which is primarily used for unsigned numbers.

3. **Arithmetic Barrel Shifter**: This type performs sign extension when shifting to the right and is mainly used for signed numbers.

### Use Cases

1. **Processors**: Many CPU architectures incorporate barrel shifters to rapidly perform bit manipulations, crucial for arithmetic calculations, data packing/unpacking, etc.

2. **Hardware Accelerators**: Dedicated hardware for applications like cryptography or signal processing often leverage fast barrel shifters.

3. **FPGAs and ASICs**: Custom circuits for specific applications may integrate barrel shifters for their speed advantage.

By offering fast and flexible shifting operations, barrel shifters play a critical role in modern digital systems. They offer a significant speed advantage, especially when time-sensitive bit manipulation is required.





Forth-83 code for a barrel shifter

To make the Z80 assembly barrel shifter code faster and more efficient, we can make the following changes:

Use a table lookup for the shift amount: Instead of using a loop to shift the value by the specified amount, we can use a table lookup to perform the shift in a single instruction. This will be much faster, especially for large shift amounts.
Use a carry flag to track the shift direction: Instead of using a separate variable to track the shift direction, we can use the carry flag. This will save us one register and make the code more concise.
Eliminate unnecessary branches: There are a few unnecessary branches in the code that we can eliminate. This will make the code more efficient and easier to optimize.
Here is a rewritten version of the barrel shifter code that incorporates these changes:
